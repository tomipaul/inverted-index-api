## Introduction
*  **`inverted-index-api`** is an express application that implements an efficient search functionality using inverted index. Rather than map a document object to an array of the terms it contains, inverted index maps a term to an array of the documents that contains it.
*  It has the following features;
  * Allow users to create index from a JSON array of document objects
  * Allow users to search index for terms

## How it works
You can check out the online version at https://inverted-index-api.herokuapp.com
*  **`inverted-index-api`** exposes two endpoints
  * api/v0/create - takes file name and file content and returns an index
    * file name is a string which represents the name of the file e.g `book1.json`
    * file content is content of the file
    * To be a valid payload (an example is shown below):
      - the file content should be a valid JSON array of document objects
      - the JSON array must not be empty
      - the document objects must have title and text properties
      - the title and text properties should be non-empty strings
  ```
    [
      {
        "title": "How to Read a book",
        "text": "Men are rational animals. Their rationality agreement is the source of their power to agree. "
      },

      {
        "title": "The Naked Ape.",
        "text": "Indeed, we have the most subtle and complex facial expression system of all living animals."
      },

      { 
  	    "title": "To Read",
  	    "text": "we use the visual system"
      }
    ]
  ```
  An example of a valid JSON payload to the endpoint will be:

  ```
    {
      "fileName": "validFile.json",
      "fileContent": [
        {
          "title": "How to Read a book",
          "text": "Men are rational animals. Their rationality agreement is the source of their power to agree. "
        },

        {
          "title": "The Naked Ape.",
          "text": "Indeed, we have the most subtle and complex facial expression system of all living animals."
        },

        {
  	      "title": "To Read",
  	      "text": "we use the visual system"
        }
      ]
    }
  ```
  It will give a response with a body similar to the sample below
  ```

      "validFile.json": {

        ],
        "visual": [
          2
        ]
      }
    }
  ```

  * api/v0/search - takes the created index, a file name and search terms and returns results for the terms

    * index must be a valid index returned as response from the `api/v0/create` route
    index is a collection of all file indexes, it may contain more than one indexed file i.e `{file1: index, file2: index ...}`
    * file name should be the name of an indexed file; when defined, the terms are looked up only in the file's index;
    when undefined, the terms are looked up in indexes of all files
    * search terms is a comma separated string of words to look up in index.
    search terms cannot be empty or undefined.

    An example of a valid JSON payload to the endpoint will be:
    ```

        "fileName: "anotherValidFile.json",
        "terms": "the, animals, edge, me"
      }
    ```
    It will give a response with a body similar to the sample below:
    ```
      {
       "anotherValidFile.json" : {
         "the": [
           1
         ],
         "fly": [

         "edge": [
           0,
           1,
           2
         ],
         "me": []
       } 
      }
    ```
    * If file name is not given, the returned object will also contain results for other files; in this case validFile.json
    * To search for simultaneous occurence of two or more words in document objects, separate words with space.
    e.g 'to go, will be, there is the' will return return results for 'to go', 'will be' and 'there is the'

## Installation and setup
You can use the online version at https://inverted-index-api.herokuapp.com
*  Install **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)**
*  Install gulp-cli globally using `npm install -g gulp-cli`
*  Navigate to a directory of choice on `terminal`.
*  Clone this repository on that directory.
  *  Using SSH;

    >`git clone git@github.com:tomipaul/inverted-index-api.git`

  *  Using HTTP;

    >`https://github.com/tomipaul/inverted-index-api.git`

*  Navigate to the repo's folder on your computer
  *  `cd inverted-index-api/`
*  Install other dependencies using `npm install`
*  Using the .env.example, create a .env file. Set the NODE_ENV to PROD, TEST or DEV and set the ports
*  Run the application using `gulp serve`
*  Running the command above will produce output that's similar to the sample below.

```

## Tests
*  The tests have been written using Jasmine framework and assertion library
*  Run the test with `gulp run-tests`
*  Running the above command will run the tests and write a coverage report using **[istanbul](https://github.com/cb1kenobi/gulp-babel-istanbul)**
*  If the tests are successful, they will complete without failures or errors.

  ```
  Finished in 0.529 seconds
  37 tests, 88 assertions, 0 failures, 0 skipped
  ```
* This will be followed by the coverage report in tabular format
